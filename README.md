## Introduction

Drawing inspiration from leading blockchain development frameworks like Remix, Third Web, and OpenZeppelin Wizard, Kernel is enhanced by finely-tuned AI models to elevate every stage of the development process. With Kernel AI, developers can streamline the entire contract development lifecycle and fast-track their development journey on Mantle Testnet’s cutting-edge infrastructure.

## Motivation

The motivation behind Kernel AI is to address the common challenges faced by smart contract developers in the Mantle ecosystem, such as:

- **Security vulnerabilities** in smart contract code  
- **Complexity of development** on L2/L3 environments  
- **Inefficiencies in the deployment process** for Mantle-based applications  
- **Lack of AI-powered development tools** for the Mantle ecosystem  

By leveraging advanced AI and providing a comprehensive suite of tools specifically designed for **Mantle**, Kernel AI aims to make smart contract development more accessible, secure, and efficient, ultimately fostering innovation and growth within the Mantle blockchain ecosystem.

## Tech Stack

Kernel AI is built using a robust tech stack to ensure performance, reliability, and scalability:

- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ShadCn  
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity  
- **Development Tools**: Resolc Compiler, Zustand, Wagmi, Privy  
- **AI/ML**: Custom trained models, Gemini API integration  
- **Backend**: Next.js, GraphQL  

## Core Features

### 1. Transaction Management Dashboard

A comprehensive dashboard to help users survey all the transactions they made on the Mantle network. The platform provides efficient AI analysis of transaction patterns, network activity, and detailed insights into your blockchain interactions with visual charts and real-time monitoring capabilities.
